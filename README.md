A custom QMK firmware is needed on the keyboard for this to work.    
I have only tested this with [my Keychron Q1 firmware development branch](https://github.com/mkillewald/qmk_firmware/tree/mkillewald_devel/keyboards/keychron/q1/rev_0100/keymaps/mkillewald) which currently uses [qmkrc](https://github.com/mmalecki/qmk_rc)
